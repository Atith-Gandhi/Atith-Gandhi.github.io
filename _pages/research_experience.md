### QAML (Question-writing Aided by Machine Learning)
*Professor Jordan Boyd-Graber, University of Maryland, College Park* <br/>
* Developed QAML (Question-writing Aided by Machine Learning), an interface for adversarial question-writing enhanced by the QANTA QA dataset. Trained and integrated language models in the interface for assisting users to write adversarial questions. Created modules for improving representation in the QA datasets. <br/>

### Bitcoin Data Analytics
*Professor Ashutosh Bhatia, SDN Lab, BITS Pilani* <br/>
Time: April 2020 - Nov 2020 <br/>
* Created a spark-based framework for supporting large-size Bitcoin transaction graph data and did link prediction and graph embedding generation using Graph Convolution Neural Networks for suspect-community detection and transaction analysis <br/>
Publication: "Bitcoin Data Analytics: Scalable techniques for transaction clustering and embedding generation," 2021 International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS), 2021, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352922 <br/>
Keywords: Big Data, Spark, GraphNN, BlockChain, Clustering <br/>

### Crop Recommender System
*Professor Lavika Goel, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani* <br/>
Time: Jan 2020 - Nov 2020 <br/>
* Develop an intelligent Crop Recommendation System that suggests relevant crops for a given soil using satellite images by combining the expertise of Remote Sensing and Machine Learning algorithms. <br/>
Publication: “Integrated Models of Machine Learning for Design of a Crop Recommendation System for Rajasthan, India” in Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing (JISRS) (2021), (Under Review) <br/>
Keywords: Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, CNN <br/>

### Federated Learning
*Professor Navneet Goyal, ADAPT Lab, BITS Pilani* <br/>
Time: Aug 2020 - Dec 2020 <br/>
* Developed an architecture to train a Lung Cancer classifier model in a Federated Learning setup. Applied Explainable AI to compare a model trained using Federated Learning vs conventional approach. <br/>
Keywords: Federated Learning, Explainable AI, Computer Vision, CNN<br/>
