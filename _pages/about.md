I am a recent undergraduate student from BITS, Pilani, where I received a B.E (Hons) in Computer Science and a Minor Degree in Data Science. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon in the Payment Products team. I have a good amount of experience working in both academia and industry on varied projects involving research and development. Previously I have worked in the fields of NLP - Question Answering (under Prof Jordan Boyd-Graber), Computer Vision/Graphics (Research Intern, Adobe), Data Mining and Big Data Technologies (SDN Lab, BITS Pilani), Federated Learing and Explainable AI (ADAPT Lab, BITS Pilani), and Remote Sensing ( under Prof Lavika Goel). I am highly interested in understanding the problem of lack of fairness and diversity in the current language models and develop solutions for building scalable and robust large Language Models that would eventually help build fair, diverse and ethical systems.
